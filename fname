"0","33991973","Influence of post-COVID-19 deconfinement on psychiatric visits to the emergency department.","During the deconfinement period after the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the number and characteristics of psychiatric visits changed in our emergency department (ED). We aimed to assess changes in the number of visits and characterize the profiles of these patients.
In this retrospective observational study, we examined the number of psychiatric ED visits and their proportion among the total number of ED visits. We also evaluated psychiatric visits characteristics during a one-month period after the declaration of deconfinement, and we compared those characteristics to characteristics observed during the same month over the previous 4 years.
The number of psychiatric visits to our emergency department during deconfinement was similar to the number observed in the same month of previous years. However, the proportion of psychiatric visits to our emergency department among all visits to the ED rose during deconfinement to a level never before observed. The mean proportion of psychiatric admissions to all ED admissions rose from 3.5% in past years to 5.3% during deconfinement (p = 0.013). Moreover, during deconfinement, more visits (80%) were without an acute intoxication compared to past years (58.5%; p = 0.031). Also, in the deconfinement period, more visits lacked a follow-up consultation organized at discharge (40%) compared to the historical period (25%, p = 0.036).
The deconfinement period after the first wave COVID-19 changed the number and type of psychiatric emergency medicine consultations at our hospital, suggesting a psychiatric impact of confinement during this pandemic. These findings will be of interest to practitioners and politicians in the coming months.","['COVID-19', 'Deconfinement', 'Emergency', 'Psychiatric']","The American journal of emergency medicine","2021-05-16","[{'lastname': 'Flament', 'firstname': 'Julien', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Emergency Department, CHU UCL Namur, Yvoir, Belgium.

"1","33991965","The perception of training and professional development according to nursing students as health workers during COVID-19: A qualitative study.","To explore the perception of education and professional development of final-year nursing students who carried out health relief tasks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global health emergency. This situation has exacerbated the need for additional healthcare employees, forcing the Spanish government to incorporate volunteer nursing students as auxiliary health staff.
A qualitative study framed in the constructivist paradigm.
Twenty-two students of nursing were recruited. A purposeful sampling was implemented until reaching saturation. A semi-structured interview as a conversational technique was used to collect information based on three dimensions: academic curriculum, disciplinary professional development, and patient care. Subsequently, a content analysis of the information was carried out. Three phases were followed in the data analysis process: theoretical, descriptive-analytical, and interpretive. The COREQ checklist was used to evaluate the study.
The most important results are linked to the students' professional and academic preparation, how the nurses handled the pandemic situation and the characteristics of the COVID-19 patients.
Students require training in order to offer holistic care to patients, adapted to the context. Participants highlight the importance of professional values and recognise a high level of competence and autonomy in nurses.","['Competence', 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)', 'Nursing', 'Qualitative study', 'Student']","Nurse education in practice","2021-05-16","[{'lastname': 'Canet-Vélez', 'firstname': 'Olga', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Health Sciences Blanquerna, University Ramon Llull, Degree of Nursing, 326-332 Padilla, St, 08025 Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Botigué', 'firstname': 'Teresa', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Lleida, 2 Montserrat Roig, St., 25198 Lleida, Spain; Health Care Research Group (GRECS), Biomedical Research Institute of Lleida, 80 Alcalde Rovira Roure, St., 25198 Lleida, Spain.
